# CrossCut: The Central Nervous System for Your Engineering Lifecycle

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Final

## 1. Executive Summary

CrossCut represents a fundamental shift in enterprise automation. It moves beyond simple, siloed task automation towards a holistic, event-driven orchestration of the entire engineering value chain. It acts as the intelligent, connective tissue between our sovereign Systems of Record (PLM, ERP, Git), transforming them from disconnected islands into a cohesive, reactive, and automated ecosystem.

At its core, CrossCut is a high-performance Go platform, architected as a "Conductor and Experts" model. A central **Business Process Orchestrator (BPO)**, powered by a stateful engine like GCP Workflows, intelligently directs a sequence of actions. However, it defers all domain-specific validation and data enrichment to the authoritative systems that own that truth. This "Federated Governance" model ensures both centralized control and decentralized authority.

By leveraging a CQRS pattern with distinct, auditable write models (Postgres) and high-performance read models (Dgraph), CrossCut provides unprecedented velocity, quality, and insight. It is a strategic platform designed to eliminate the friction between our systems and supercharge our engineering teams for the era of AI-driven development.

## 2. The Challenge: The High Cost of Disconnected Work

In modern engineering, our greatest source of friction, delay, and error exists in the gaps *between* our specialized systems. The PLM, the ERP, the Git repository, and the Test Management System are all powerful domains, but they are islands of truth, separated by oceans of manual processes.

This disconnect forces our most valuable asset—our engineers—to act as human APIs, manually bridging these gaps. They copy-paste data, create tickets, chase statuses, and translate information from one domain to another. The "process" lives in checklists, tribal knowledge, and the heroic efforts of individuals.

This model is fundamentally broken:
*   **Process Opacity and Brittleness:** The end-to-end process is not explicit or auditable. A minor change in one team's workflow can have unforeseen, cascading consequences.
*   **Latency by Design:** Value is created in discrete steps, but days or weeks are lost in the manual handoffs between them. The speed of the business is throttled by the speed of a status meeting.
*   **Inhibits True Automation:** We can automate tasks *within* a silo, but we cannot automate the end-to-end value stream, leaving the most significant opportunities for efficiency on the table.

## 3. The Vision: From Manual Handoffs to an Automated Value Chain

**CrossCut** represents a paradigm shift. It is not another silo; it is the intelligent, connective tissue that binds our existing systems into a single, cohesive, and reactive whole.

**CrossCut is the tireless, expert Project Manager for our automated engineering processes.**

It knows the entire playbook, from a new schematic release to the final product shipment. When a critical event happens in one domain, CrossCut doesn't just record it; it understands its implications and orchestrates a coordinated, multi-domain response to drive the business process forward.

It automates the tedious and elevates the human. It ensures that the right work happens at the right time, with the right information, every single time. It transforms our collection of siloed tools into a true, automated value chain.

## 4. The CrossCut Solution: The "Conductor and Experts" Paradigm

CrossCut is built on a foundation of clear, disciplined architectural principles. It treats business processes not as a series of manual handoffs, but as a **stateful, automated, and auditable workflow**.

### 4.1. Core Principles

*   **Orchestration, Not Ownership:** CrossCut is a conductor, not a dictator. It respects the sovereignty of our core Systems of Record. The PLM remains the king of engineering data; the ERP remains the king of business data. CrossCut's role is to orchestrate the flow of work *between* these expert systems.

*   **Events are the Lifeblood:** CrossCut operates in real-time. It subscribes to the critical business events published by our core systems, treating every change as a potential trigger for a new, value-creating workflow.

*   **Logic Lives with the Experts (Federated Governance):** CrossCut does not presume to be an expert in every domain. Engineering validation logic lives within the PLM. Business rule validation lives within the ERP. CrossCut's role is to formally *consult* these experts during a workflow.

*   **Auditability by Design:** Every automated process orchestrated by CrossCut is a durable, queryable, and transparent record. The "why" behind every action is no longer hidden in an email chain; it is an explicit part of the workflow's auditable history.

### 4.2. Key Architectural Concepts

These principles are realized through four core architectural concepts:

*   **The Business Process Orchestrator (BPO):** This is the **"Conductor"**. A smart, Go-based service that acts as the brain of the operation. Triggered by a business event (e.g., `SchematicReleased`), it consults its read model to understand the required process and assembles an initial plan. Its domain is the *process itself*, not the data within it.

*   **The Stateful Workflow Engine (GCP Workflows):** This is the **"Spinal Cord"**. A managed service that executes the long-running, stateful sequence of actions designed by the BPO. It handles the complexities of retries, parallelism, and waiting, providing resilience and visibility.

*   **The Federated Governance Model:** This is the **"Council of Experts"**. CrossCut does not own domain logic; it defers to it. The BPO, via the workflow, makes formal API calls to the authoritative Systems of Record (PLM, ERP) to validate actions and enrich the plan with their unimpeachable data.

*   **The CQRS Data Platform:** This is the **"Institutional Memory"**. CrossCut maintains its own state using two specialized databases:
    *   **The Write Model (Postgres/Anchor Model):** An auditable, immutable log of every decision and action the platform takes. It is optimized for transactional integrity and historical accuracy.
    *   **The Read Model (Dgraph/Graph Model):** A high-performance, denormalized cache of data from all relevant systems. It is the "World Model" the BPO consults to make fast, context-aware decisions.

## 5. Architectural Strengths & Key Benefits

*   **Centralized Orchestration, Decentralized Authority:** We gain a single, auditable view of our end-to-end business processes without creating a monolithic "God" service. Each domain retains full ownership of its data and rules.

*   **Unbreakable Auditability & Traceability:** The event-driven nature and the immutable write log mean that every automated process is a complete, queryable record. We can instantly answer "Why did this happen?"

*   **Extreme Agility & Evolvability:** A new business process is simply a new GCP Workflow definition. New listeners can be added to events without changing the original publisher, thanks to the Pub/Sub backbone.

*   **Cloud-Native Resilience & Scalability:** By leveraging managed services like GCP Workflows, Cloud Run, and Pub/Sub, the platform is inherently resilient and can scale to meet any demand.

*   **AI-Powered Process Augmentation:** CrossCut is the perfect platform to safely integrate AI. An LLM can be used within the BPO to generate *template plans*, which are then passed through the Federated Governance gauntlet for validation by the authoritative SoRs.

## 6. The Workflow Lifecycle: An Example

1.  **TRIGGER:** The PLM system releases a new board revision, publishing a `SchematicReleased` event to Pub/Sub.
2.  **ORCHESTRATE:** A GCP Workflow is triggered. Its first step is to command the BPO to design a response plan.
3.  **DECIDE:** The BPO consumes the event, queries its Dgraph "World Model" for context, and generates a template plan to create a new test procedure.
4.  **VALIDATE & ENRICH:** The workflow sends this template plan to the PLM's `/enrich` endpoint. The PLM validates it against its engineering rules and injects the authoritative voltage spec.
5.  **EXECUTE:** The workflow receives the final, validated plan and dispatches commands in parallel: one to `DocGen` to render the document, and another to the WMS to create a new `WorkItem` for the test.
6.  **AUDIT:** Upon completion, the workflow commands the BPO to write a final, comprehensive record of the entire process to the Postgres audit log.

## 7. Conclusion

CrossCut is more than an automation tool; it is a new operational model. It codifies our business processes into explicit, testable, and auditable assets. By acting as the intelligent central nervous system for our engineering lifecycle, it eliminates systemic friction, supercharges our teams, and provides the strategic foundation needed to build a truly automated, high-velocity enterprise.
