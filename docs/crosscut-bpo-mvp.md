## CrossCut MVP Specification: The "First Automated Workflow"

**STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

*Implementation Date: September 21, 2025*
*All MVP requirements have been fulfilled and tested.*

### 1. MVP Goal

To build and run a self-contained, end-to-end demonstration of a cross-domain business process. The MVP will prove that the `crosscut-bpo` service can be triggered by an event, consult an external "expert" service (a mock PLM) to enrich a plan, and then command a "worker" service (a mock DocGen) to perform an action.

This MVP is successful if we can trace a single, simulated `SchematicReleased` event through the entire lifecycle, resulting in a final, auditable record.

### 2. Scope & Simplifications for Codespaces

| Full Architecture Component | MVP Simplification | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GCP Workflows | **In-Process Orchestration.** A single function call within the BPO will execute the sequence. | Avoids dependency on a managed cloud service. The *logic* of the sequence is what we're testing. |
| Unified Postgres DB | **A local `audit-log.json` file.** The BPO reads from and writes to this single file. | Simulates a unified read/write model without the overhead of running a database. |
| PLM & ERP Services | **A single `mock-plm-service`.** | Proves the "expert" pattern with one simple, controllable mock. |
| DocGen2 & VizGen Workers | **A single `mock-docgen-service`.** | Proves the "worker" pattern. Doesn't need to generate a real document. |
| Pub/Sub | **A `curl` command to a REST endpoint.** | Simulates an event trigger in the simplest way possible for a developer. |

### 3. MVP Components

The entire MVP will run within a single `docker-compose.yml` file, making it instantly launchable in GitHub Codespaces.

1.  **`crosscut-bpo` (The Brain):** The core Go service. It will expose one primary REST endpoint to trigger the workflow. It will use a single `audit-log.json` file to maintain its process audit trail, demonstrating the audit-centric approach where CrossCut owns only its own orchestration data.
2.  **`mock-plm-service` (The Expert):** A tiny Go or Python web service (e.g., using Gin or Flask). It exposes one endpoint: `POST /enrich-plan`. It reads its own "database" from a `plm-data.json` file to find the correct voltage for a given product.
3.  **`mock-docgen-service` (The Worker):** A web service implementing the DocGen2 API contract. It exposes multiple endpoints including `POST /generate` for document generation. It receives enriched document plans, logs them for verification, and returns fake document URLs. Full API specification: [`mock-docgen-openapi.yaml`](mock-docgen-openapi.yaml).

### 4. The End-to-End MVP Flow: "Happy Path"

This is the entire test case for the MVP.

1.  **Setup:** The developer opens the repository in a GitHub Codespace and runs `docker-compose up -d`. All three services start.

2.  **The Trigger (Simulating a Pub/Sub Event):** The developer runs a single `curl` command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "trigger_event": "schematic.released",
      "payload": {
        "product_name": "ROUTER-100",
        "revision": "C"
      }
    }' \
    http://localhost:8080/v1/execute-workflow
    ```

3.  **The Orchestration (What happens inside the containers):**
    a. The `crosscut-bpo` service receives the request.
    b. It reads its history from `audit-log.json` to determine that a `schematic.released` event requires a `DVT_Procedure` to be created.
    c. It generates a "template plan": `{"product": "ROUTER-100", "components": [{"name": "PowerTest", "voltage": "UNRESOLVED"}]}`.
    d. It dynamically consults the `mock-plm-service` via HTTP call to get fresh business context for this template plan.
    e. The `mock-plm-service` reads its own authoritative data from `plm-data.json`, finds that `ROUTER-100` requires `12V`, and returns the enriched plan: `{"...": "...", "voltage": "12V"}`.
    f. The `crosscut-bpo` service receives the fresh, authoritative data from the SoR.
    g. It makes an HTTP call to the `mock-docgen-service` at `POST /generate` with the final, resolved document plan.
    h. The `mock-docgen-service` prints "Received render job for ROUTER-100 with voltage 12V" to the container logs and returns `{"status": "success", "url": "gcs://fake-bucket/ROUTER-100-DVT-Procedure-Rev-C-20241201-143022.docx", "filename": "ROUTER-100-DVT-Procedure-Rev-C.docx"}`.
    i. The `crosscut-bpo` service receives the success response.
    j. It writes a final entry to `audit-log.json` confirming the workflow completed successfully with the generated artifact URL.
    k. It returns a `200 OK` to the original `curl` command.

4.  **Verification:** The developer checks two things:
    *   The logs of the `mock-docgen-service` container to confirm it received the correct, enriched data.
    *   The contents of the `audit-log.json` file to confirm the entire process was recorded.

### 5. Repository Structure

```
/
├── crosscut-bpo/              # Main Go service (BPO)
├── mock-plm-service/          # Mock PLM expert service
├── mock-docgen-service/       # Mock document generation worker
├── data/                      # Simulated data stores
│   ├── plm-data.json
│   └── audit-log.json
└── docker-compose.yml         # MVP deployment configuration
```

This structure aligns with the MVP architecture described in CLAUDE.md and supports the implementation roadmap:
- **MVP:** Single workflow with mock services and file-based storage (current scope)
- **Phase 1:** Real PostgreSQL with Anchor Model and materialized views
- **Phase 2:** Additional workflows and external service integrations
- **Phase 3:** Migration to full CQRS with dedicated read database if needed

This MVP is achievable, demonstrates immense value, and perfectly tests the core architectural hypothesis in a simple, developer-friendly environment.

### 6. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Implementation Plan

The MVP will be implemented using Test-Driven Development principles, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. This approach ensures we build exactly what's needed for the happy path while maintaining high code quality and comprehensive test coverage.

#### 6.1 TDD Strategy Overview

**Testing Philosophy:**
- **Outside-In TDD:** Start with end-to-end acceptance tests, then drill down to unit tests
- **Behavior-Driven:** Tests describe the business value and expected behaviors
- **Audit-Centric:** Every test validates that audit trail is properly maintained
- **Service Isolation:** Each service has its own test suite with clear boundaries

**Test Hierarchy:**
1. **E2E Integration Tests:** Full workflow from curl command to audit log verification
2. **Service Integration Tests:** HTTP API behavior for each service
3. **Unit Tests:** Individual functions and business logic
4. **Contract Tests:** API agreements between services (using OpenAPI specifications)

#### 6.2 Phase 1: End-to-End Acceptance Test (RED)

**Goal:** Write the failing test that describes the complete MVP workflow

```go
// e2e_test.go
func TestSchematicReleasedWorkflow(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: All services are running and data files exist
    setupMVPEnvironment(t)

    // When: A schematic.released event is triggered
    response := triggerWorkflow(t, SchematicReleasedEvent{
        ProductName: "ROUTER-100",
        Revision:    "C",
    })

    // Then: Workflow completes successfully
    assert.Equal(t, 200, response.StatusCode)

    // And: PLM was consulted for voltage data
    assertPLMWasConsulted(t, "ROUTER-100")

    // And: DocGen received enriched plan with correct voltage
    assertDocGenReceived(t, ExpectedPlan{
        Product: "ROUTER-100",
        Voltage: "12V",
    })

    // And: Complete audit trail exists
    auditEntries := readAuditLog(t)
    assertWorkflowAuditTrail(t, auditEntries, "schematic.released", "ROUTER-100")
}
```

**Expected Result:** Test fails because no services exist yet

#### 6.3 Phase 2: Mock Service Development (GREEN)

**Build minimal services to make the E2E test pass**

##### 6.3.1 Mock PLM Service Tests & Implementation

```go
// mock-plm-service/main_test.go
func TestPLMEnrichPlan(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: PLM service with ROUTER-100 data
    setupPLMData(t, PLMProduct{
        Name:    "ROUTER-100",
        Voltage: "12V",
    })

    // When: POST /enrich-plan with template
    response := postEnrichPlan(t, TemplatePlan{
        Product:    "ROUTER-100",
        Components: []Component{{Name: "PowerTest", Voltage: "UNRESOLVED"}},
    })

    // Then: Returns enriched plan with voltage
    assert.Equal(t, 200, response.StatusCode)
    plan := parsePlan(response.Body)
    assert.Equal(t, "12V", plan.Components[0].Voltage)
}

func TestPLMProductNotFound(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: PLM service without UNKNOWN-PRODUCT
    setupPLMData(t, []PLMProduct{})

    // When: POST /enrich-plan with unknown product
    response := postEnrichPlan(t, TemplatePlan{Product: "UNKNOWN-PRODUCT"})

    // Then: Returns 404 with error message
    assert.Equal(t, 404, response.StatusCode)
    assert.Contains(t, response.Body, "product not found")
}
```

**Implementation:** Build minimal HTTP server that reads `plm-data.json` and enriches plans

##### 6.3.2 Mock DocGen Service Tests & Implementation

**API Contract:** All tests must comply with [`mock-docgen-openapi.yaml`](mock-docgen-openapi.yaml) specification.

```go
// mock-docgen-service/main_test.go
func TestDocGenGenerate(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: DocGen service is running
    // When: POST /generate with enriched document plan (per OpenAPI spec)
    response := postGenerate(t, DocumentPlan{
        DocProps: DocProps{Filename: "ROUTER-100-DVT-Procedure-Rev-C"},
        Body: []ComponentInstance{{
            Component: "TestBlock",
            Props: map[string]interface{}{
                "test_name": "PowerTest",
                "voltage": "12V",
                "product_name": "ROUTER-100",
            },
        }},
    })

    // Then: Returns success with document URL (per OpenAPI spec)
    assert.Equal(t, 200, response.StatusCode)
    result := parseGenerateResult(response.Body)
    assert.Equal(t, "success", result.Status)
    assert.Contains(t, result.URL, "gcs://fake-bucket/")
    assert.Contains(t, result.Filename, "ROUTER-100")
}

func TestDocGenLogsReceivedData(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: DocGen service with log capture
    logCapture := setupLogCapture(t)

    // When: POST /generate with document plan
    postGenerate(t, DocumentPlan{Body: []ComponentInstance{{Component: "TestBlock", Props: map[string]interface{}{"product": "ROUTER-100", "voltage": "12V"}}}})

    // Then: Logs contain received data
    assert.Contains(t, logCapture.Output(), "Received render job for ROUTER-100 with voltage 12V")
}
```

**Implementation:** Build HTTP server that logs received data and returns fake document URLs

##### 6.3.3 CrossCut BPO Service Tests & Implementation

```go
// crosscut-bpo/internal/workflow_test.go
func TestExecuteWorkflow(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: BPO with mock PLM and DocGen services
    bpo := setupBPO(t, MockPLM{URL: "http://mock-plm:8081"}, MockDocGen{URL: "http://mock-docgen:8082"})

    // When: POST /v1/execute-workflow
    response := bpo.ExecuteWorkflow(t, WorkflowRequest{
        TriggerEvent: "schematic.released",
        Payload:      map[string]string{"product_name": "ROUTER-100", "revision": "C"},
    })

    // Then: Returns success
    assert.Equal(t, 200, response.StatusCode)

    // And: Audit log contains workflow steps
    auditEntries := bpo.ReadAuditLog(t)
    assertContains(t, auditEntries, "workflow_started", "plm_consulted", "docgen_commanded", "workflow_completed")
}

func TestBPOAuditTrail(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: BPO with audit logging
    bpo := setupBPO(t)

    // When: Various workflow operations
    bpo.LogWorkflowStart("schematic.released", "ROUTER-100")
    bpo.LogSoRConsultation("PLM", "enrich-plan", "success")
    bpo.LogWorkerCommand("DocGen", "render", "success")
    bpo.LogWorkflowComplete("success", "gcs://fake-bucket/doc-123.docx")

    // Then: Audit log contains all entries with timestamps
    entries := bpo.ReadAuditLog(t)
    assert.Len(t, entries, 4)
    assertTimestampsInOrder(t, entries)
}

func TestBPOSoRConsultation(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: BPO with PLM client
    mockPLM := setupMockPLM(t)
    bpo := setupBPO(t, mockPLM)

    // When: Consulting PLM for plan enrichment
    enrichedPlan := bpo.ConsultPLM(t, "ROUTER-100", TemplatePlan{})

    // Then: Returns enriched plan
    assert.Equal(t, "12V", enrichedPlan.Components[0].Voltage)

    // And: HTTP call was made to PLM
    mockPLM.AssertCalled(t, "POST", "/enrich-plan")
}
```

**Implementation:** Build Go HTTP server with audit logging, SoR consultation, and workflow orchestration

#### 6.4 Phase 3: Integration & Docker Compose (GREEN)

**Goal:** Make all services work together via docker-compose

```go
// integration_test.go
func TestDockerComposeEnvironment(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: All services running via docker-compose
    setupDockerEnvironment(t)
    defer teardownDockerEnvironment(t)

    // When: Running the full workflow via curl
    response := curlWorkflowTrigger(t, "http://localhost:8080/v1/execute-workflow")

    // Then: All services communicate successfully
    assert.Equal(t, 200, response.StatusCode)

    // And: Docker logs show proper service interaction
    assertServiceLogs(t, "crosscut-bpo", "PLM consultation successful")
    assertServiceLogs(t, "mock-plm-service", "Enriching plan for ROUTER-100")
    assertServiceLogs(t, "mock-docgen-service", "Received render job for ROUTER-100 with voltage 12V")
}

func TestDataPersistence(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: Services with file-based storage
    setupDockerEnvironment(t)
    defer teardownDockerEnvironment(t)

    // When: Running workflow
    curlWorkflowTrigger(t)

    // Then: Audit log persists to volume
    auditLog := readFileFromVolume(t, "data/audit-log.json")
    assert.NotEmpty(t, auditLog)
    assertValidJSON(t, auditLog)
}
```

#### 6.5 Phase 4: Error Handling & Edge Cases (REFACTOR)

**Goal:** Add comprehensive error handling and edge cases

```go
func TestPLMServiceUnavailable(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: PLM service is down
    setupBPOWithoutPLM(t)

    // When: Workflow triggered
    response := triggerWorkflow(t)

    // Then: Returns error and logs failure
    assert.Equal(t, 500, response.StatusCode)
    auditEntries := readAuditLog(t)
    assertContains(t, auditEntries, "plm_consultation_failed")
}

func TestInvalidWorkflowEvent(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: BPO service
    bpo := setupBPO(t)

    // When: Unknown event type triggered
    response := bpo.ExecuteWorkflow(t, WorkflowRequest{TriggerEvent: "unknown.event"})

    // Then: Returns validation error
    assert.Equal(t, 400, response.StatusCode)
    assert.Contains(t, response.Body, "unknown event type")
}

func TestAuditLogCorruption(t *testing.T) {
    // Given: Corrupted audit log file
    writeCorruptedAuditLog(t)

    // When: BPO starts
    bpo := setupBPO(t)

    // Then: Handles corruption gracefully
    auditEntries := bpo.ReadAuditLog(t)
    assert.NotNil(t, auditEntries) // Should not crash
}
```

#### 6.6 Test Execution Strategy

**Development Order:**
1. **Write E2E test first** (RED) - defines the complete behavior
2. **Build mock-plm-service** (GREEN) - simplest service with file I/O
3. **Build mock-docgen-service** (GREEN) - simple HTTP endpoint
4. **Build crosscut-bpo core** (GREEN) - orchestration logic
5. **Add docker-compose integration** (GREEN) - containerized testing
6. **Add error handling** (REFACTOR) - comprehensive edge cases
7. **Performance & cleanup** (REFACTOR) - optimization

**Test Categories by Priority:**
1. **Happy Path:** Core workflow end-to-end
2. **API Contract Compliance:** Verify services match OpenAPI specifications
3. **Service Contracts:** API behavior for each service
4. **Audit Trail:** Complete audit logging functionality
5. **Error Handling:** Network failures, invalid data, service unavailability
6. **Data Persistence:** File I/O, JSON parsing, data validation
7. **Performance:** Response times, concurrent requests

**Continuous Integration:**
- Each commit must pass all existing tests
- New features require tests first (RED), then implementation (GREEN)
- Refactoring maintains test coverage (REFACTOR)
- Docker-based testing environment for CI/CD pipeline

This TDD approach ensures the MVP is built incrementally with high confidence, comprehensive test coverage, and clear documentation of expected behaviors through executable specifications.
