# CrossCut: The Central Nervous System for Your Engineering Lifecycle

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Final

## 1. Executive Summary

CrossCut represents a fundamental shift in enterprise automation. It moves beyond simple, siloed task automation towards a holistic, event-driven orchestration of the entire engineering value chain. It acts as the intelligent, connective tissue between our sovereign Systems of Record (PLM, ERP, Git), transforming them from disconnected islands into a cohesive, reactive, and automated ecosystem.

At its core, CrossCut is a high-performance Go platform, architected as a "Conductor and Experts" model. A central **Business Process Orchestrator (BPO)**, powered by a stateful engine like GCP Workflows, intelligently directs a sequence of actions. However, it defers all domain-specific validation and data enrichment to the authoritative systems that own that truth. This "Federated Governance" model ensures both centralized control and decentralized authority.

By leveraging a CQRS pattern with distinct, auditable write models (Postgres) and high-performance read models (Dgraph), CrossCut provides unprecedented velocity, quality, and insight. It is a strategic platform designed to eliminate the friction between our systems and supercharge our engineering teams for the era of AI-driven development.

## 2. The Motivation: The High Cost of Disconnected Work

Modern engineering thrives on specialized, powerful tools. Our PLM, ERP, and source control are experts in their domains. However, our greatest source of friction, delay, and error exists in the gaps *between* these systems. The business process itself lives in checklists, email chains, and the heroic, manual efforts of our engineers.

This model is fundamentally broken:

*   **Human APIs:** We force our most valuable technical staff to act as human APIs, manually copy-pasting data, creating tickets, and translating information from one system to another. This is a profound waste of talent and time.
*   **Process Opacity and Brittleness:** The end-to-end process is not explicit or auditable. A minor change in one team's workflow can have unforeseen, cascading consequences, and diagnosing failures requires a painful archaeological dig through multiple systems.
*   **Latency by Design:** Value is created in discrete steps, but days or weeks are lost in the manual handoffs between them. The speed of the business is throttled by the speed of a status meeting.
*   **Inhibits True Automation:** We can automate tasks *within* a silo, but we cannot automate the end-to-end value stream. This leaves the most significant opportunities for efficiency and quality improvement on the table.

CrossCut was designed from the ground up to solve this systemic problem.

## 3. The CrossCut Solution: The "Conductor and Experts" Paradigm

CrossCut treats business processes not as a series of manual handoffs, but as a **stateful, automated, and auditable workflow**. It orchestrates the flow of value by consulting experts, not by trying to be one. This is achieved through four core architectural concepts:

#### 3.1 The Business Process Orchestrator (BPO)
This is the **"Conductor"**. A smart, Go-based service that acts as the brain of the operation. Triggered by a business event (e.g., `SchematicReleased`), it consults its read model to understand the required process and assembles the initial plan. Its domain is the *process itself*, not the data within it.

#### 3.2 The Stateful Workflow Engine (GCP Workflows)
This is the **"Spinal Cord"**. A managed service that executes the long-running, stateful sequence of actions designed by the BPO. It handles the complexities of retries, parallelism, and waiting, providing resilience and visibility into the execution of the process.

#### 3.3 The Federated Governance Model
This is the **"Council of Experts"**. CrossCut does not own domain logic; it defers to it. Before taking a critical action, the BPO, via the workflow, makes formal API calls to the authoritative Systems of Record (PLM, ERP). These systems validate the action and enrich the plan with their own unimpeachable data. This ensures logic lives with the data owner.

#### 3.4 The CQRS Data Platform
This is the **"Institutional Memory"**. CrossCut maintains its own state using two specialized databases:
*   **The Write Model (Postgres/Anchor Model):** An auditable, immutable log of every decision and action the platform takes. It is optimized for transactional integrity and historical accuracy.
*   **The Read Model (Dgraph/Graph Model):** A high-performance, denormalized cache of data from all relevant systems. It is the "World Model" the BPO consults to make fast, context-aware decisions.

## 4. Architectural Strengths & Key Benefits

The CrossCut architecture provides transformative benefits over traditional, siloed automation.

#### ✅ **Centralized Orchestration, Decentralized Authority**
This is the core paradigm. We gain a single, auditable view of our end-to-end business processes without creating a monolithic "God" service. Each domain retains full ownership of its data and rules, making the system both robust and politically viable.

#### ✅ **Unbreakable Auditability & Traceability**
The event-driven nature and the immutable Anchor Model write log mean that every automated process is a complete, queryable record. We can instantly answer "Why did this happen?" and trace any action back to the specific event and business rule that triggered it.

#### ✅ **Extreme Agility & Evolvability**
The platform is designed for change. A new business process is simply a new GCP Workflow definition. A new listener to an existing event (e.g., a new "Compliance Check" service) can be added without ever changing the original publisher, thanks to the Pub/Sub backbone.

#### ✅ **Cloud-Native Resilience & Scalability**
By leveraging managed services like GCP Workflows, Cloud Run, and Pub/Sub, the platform is inherently resilient and scalable. The stateless BPO can be scaled horizontally to handle any decision load, while the workflow engine provides durable, persistent execution.

#### ✅ **AI-Powered Process Augmentation**
CrossCut is the perfect platform to safely integrate AI. An LLM can be used within the BPO to generate *template plans*, which are then passed through the Federated Governance gauntlet for validation and enrichment by the authoritative SoRs. This leverages AI's creative strengths while guaranteeing correctness and compliance.

## 5. The Workflow Lifecycle: An Example

1.  **TRIGGER:** The PLM system releases a new board revision, publishing a `SchematicReleased` event to Pub/Sub.
2.  **ORCHESTRATE:** A GCP Workflow is triggered. Its first step is to command the BPO to design a response plan.
3.  **DECIDE:** The BPO consumes the event, queries its Dgraph "World Model" for context, and generates a template plan to create a new test procedure.
4.  **VALIDATE & ENRICH:** The workflow sends this template plan to the PLM's `/enrich` endpoint. The PLM validates it against its engineering rules and injects the authoritative voltage spec.
5.  **EXECUTE:** The workflow receives the final, validated plan and dispatches commands in parallel: one to `DocGen` to render the document, and another to the WMS to create a new `WorkItem` for the test.
6.  **AUDIT:** Upon completion, the workflow commands the BPO to write a final, comprehensive record of the entire process—including the trigger, decisions, and generated artifacts—to the Postgres audit log.

## 6. Conclusion

CrossCut is more than an automation tool; it is a new operational model. It codifies our business processes into explicit, testable, and auditable assets. By acting as the intelligent central nervous system for our engineering lifecycle, it eliminates systemic friction, supercharges our teams, and provides the strategic foundation needed to build a truly automated, high-velocity enterprise.
