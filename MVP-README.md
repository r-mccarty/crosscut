# CrossCut MVP: Successfully Implemented! 🎉

## Overview

The CrossCut MVP has been successfully implemented according to the platform specifications. This MVP demonstrates the "Conductor and Experts" paradigm with a complete end-to-end workflow that orchestrates cross-domain business processes.

### Key Features ✅

- **Audit-Centric Architecture**: CrossCut owns only process orchestration data
- **Dynamic SoR Consultation**: Real-time querying of authoritative systems
- **Complete Workflow Orchestration**: End-to-end "SchematicReleased" → DVT Document Generation
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Every action recorded with timestamps and details
- **Service Isolation**: Clear boundaries between orchestration, experts, and workers

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Running the MVP

**Option A: Direct Go Execution (Recommended for Development)**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Mock PLM Service
cd mock-plm-service
PLM_DATA_PATH=../data/plm-data.json go run main.go

# Terminal 2: Start Mock DocGen Service
cd mock-docgen-service
PORT=8082 go run main.go

# Terminal 3: Start CrossCut BPO Service
cd crosscut-bpo
PLM_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8081 \
DOCGEN_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8082 \
AUDIT_LOG_PATH=../data/audit-log.json \
go run main.go
```

**Option B: Docker Compose (Full Containerized Environment)**

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Or run in background
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 2. Testing the Workflow

**Execute the MVP workflow with a single curl command:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "trigger_event": "schematic.released",
  "payload": {
    "product_name": "ROUTER-100",
    "revision": "C"
  }
}' \
http://localhost:8080/v1/execute-workflow
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "workflow_id": "wf-1758425317",
  "message": "Workflow completed successfully",
  "document_url": "gcs://fake-bucket/ROUTER-100-DVT-Procedure-Rev-C-20250921-032837.docx"
}
```

### 3. Automated Testing

**Run the comprehensive test suite:**

```bash
./test-mvp.sh
```

This script will:
- Verify all services are healthy
- Execute end-to-end workflows
- Validate audit trail completeness
- Test error handling scenarios
- Verify different product types (ROUTER-100, SWITCH-200)

## What Happens During Workflow Execution

### The Complete Flow

1. **Event Trigger**: `schematic.released` event received by BPO
2. **Template Generation**: BPO creates template plan with "UNRESOLVED" voltage
3. **PLM Consultation**: BPO queries PLM service for voltage enrichment
4. **Plan Enrichment**: PLM returns authoritative voltage data (12V for ROUTER-100)
5. **DocGen Command**: BPO commands DocGen service with enriched plan
6. **Document Generation**: DocGen creates fake document and returns URL
7. **Audit Recording**: Complete workflow recorded in audit trail

### Service Logs Verification

**PLM Service logs:**
```
2025/09/21 03:28:37 Enriching plan for product: ROUTER-100
2025/09/21 03:28:37 Successfully enriched plan for ROUTER-100 with 1 components
```

**DocGen Service logs:**
```
2025/09/21 03:28:37 Received render job for ROUTER-100 with voltage 12V
2025/09/21 03:28:37 Successfully generated document: ROUTER-100-DVT-Procedure-Rev-C.docx (2 components)
```

**BPO Service logs:**
```
2025/09/21 03:28:37 Executing workflow wf-1758425317 for event: schematic.released
2025/09/21 03:28:37 Workflow wf-1758425317 completed successfully
```

## Implementation Highlights

### ✅ Specification Compliance

- **RFD 2**: Unified PostgreSQL architecture (simulated with file storage for MVP)
- **RFD 3**: Audit-centric data model with dynamic SoR consultation
- **MVP Spec**: Complete "SchematicReleased" workflow implementation
- **OpenAPI Compliance**: DocGen service follows the provided specification

### ✅ Architectural Principles

- **Conductor and Experts**: Clear separation between orchestration and domain logic
- **Data Boundaries**: CrossCut owns process data, SoRs own business data
- **Event-Driven**: Workflow triggered by business events
- **Immutable Audit**: Complete traceability of all orchestration actions

### ✅ Technology Stack

- **Go 1.21**: All services implemented in Go
- **HTTP APIs**: RESTful communication between services
- **JSON**: Structured data exchange
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **File Storage**: MVP-appropriate persistence layer

## Next Steps (Evolution Path)

1. **Phase 1**: Migrate to PostgreSQL with Anchor Model
2. **Phase 2**: Add real SoR integrations and GCP Workflows
3. **Phase 3**: Scale to full CQRS if performance demands require

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- ✅ Single `curl` command triggers complete end-to-end workflow
- ✅ Complete audit trail captured in `audit-log.json`
- ✅ Mock services receive enriched data as specified
- ✅ All services run via `docker-compose up -d`
- ✅ Workflow completes with generated document URL
- ✅ PLM service consulted for voltage enrichment
- ✅ DocGen service receives enriched plan with correct voltage
- ✅ Complete audit trail exists with all workflow steps

## Demonstration

The CrossCut MVP successfully demonstrates:

1. **Cross-domain orchestration** between PLM and DocGen systems
2. **Audit-centric architecture** with complete process traceability
3. **Dynamic SoR consultation** for fresh, authoritative business data
4. **Service isolation** with clear data ownership boundaries
5. **Event-driven workflows** triggered by business events

**The MVP is ready for demonstration and serves as a solid foundation for evolution to the full platform architecture.**
